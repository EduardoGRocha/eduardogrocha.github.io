Ol√° mundo! 

This is the first blog post to test the template and the workflow. 
The main goal of this blog is to use as journal where I document my progress in 
personal coding projects, which hopefully will motivate me to push them forward.

The primary goal isn't to get any audience, but I'm always happy to know if something 
that I shared was useful.
